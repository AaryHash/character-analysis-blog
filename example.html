                    <img src="images/anthony-cropped.png">
                    <p>The first time we meet Anthony, he is wearing a simple hoodie and jeans with a striped blue shirt underneath. He does not put much effort into his first day of class, showcasing the lazy personality that viewers will come to know and love throughout the show. He also wears glasses and is reading a book, connecting to his intelligent side and showing why he belongs in an AP Biology class--he may be lazy, but his brain is more important. The glasses are a small fit on him, exemplifying his big stature, another characteristic that proves to be useful in the antics throughout the show when he is expected to lift heavy things and protect his pupils. Finally, the amount of blue in his outfit connects to his calm and demure nature, as well as his strong loyalty.</p>

                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/colin-cropped.png">
                    <p>The first time we see Colin, he's wearing a simple flannel with a nondescript t-shirt and jeans. In complete contrast to Anthony, who sits right in front of him, Colin is wearing clothing that hardly displays any personality at all. He hardly has a personality throughout the show, and ends up leaving after just one season. It seems like Colin was overall not fleshed out as a character, and did not have his own unique traits (he was just "ugly" and had low self esteem, much like many other characters in the show).</p>

                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/marcus-cropped.png">
                    <p>Marcus's first scene depicts him with a clean polo and khakis, as well as glasses and a watch as accessories. His polo is a darker color than any of the other characters, portraying the way he stands out from his peers (they generally dislike him). However, he also wears light blue sneakers, shoes that seem to misalign with the rest of his outfit. His outfit otherwise seems salesman-inspired, professional but unlikeable and slightly elitist, but his sneakers show how he is still a high school student and immediately foreshadows how he wants to fit in and be liked by his peers, even if he believes himself to be incredibly smart, likes to show it, and has few social skills.</p>

                <h3 id="devin-profile">Devin's Positioning</h3>
                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/devin-cropped.png">
                    <p>Devin is hard to spot, as he hides in the back of the classroom behind characters that have 0-1 lines throughout the whole show. Devin is an important character in AP Bio, with many lines throughout the season he was on, so why place him behind extras? Positioning of a character in a scene can be important to developing their personality, especially in a high school setting where choosing a seat on the first day is often seen as crucial to students. Devin is being bullied when the show starts due to being a quiet and dark individual who enjoys talking about demons, so his choice to sit at the back is understandable. However, while he pretends to not care about anything, he still walks across the entire room to sit as far from the doors as possible, instead of seating himself at the first seat he sees. Devin cares deeply about situations throughout the show, and much like his teacher Jack Griffin, he only pretends to not care to protect himself.</p>

                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/sarika-cropped.png">
                    <p>Sarika positions herself at the front of the class, as expected for her character because she plays the "straight character" that comedies tend to have--the character that acts realistic in a room full of over the top people. She seats herself next to Anthony, a calming and safe figure, and next to Marcus, the other incredibly smart and driven individual in the class. However, they contrast strongly in their personalities, with Sarika caring more about grades and getting into Harvard and Marcus caring more about being seen by his peers as intelligent. As such, Sarika is well-liked by her peers and still engages in many of the games and antics that occur throughout the show.</p>

                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/heather-cropped.png">
                    <p>Heather quickly became the breakout star of the show, but she started off as an almost invisible girl in the middle of the fray. Heather is an interesting character, as she has the same bloodthirst inside of her as the teacher has, making her a perfect wingman for his missions. However, she is also nerdy and has big glasses that make eye contact difficult, so she is expected to be quiet and keep her twisted remarks to herself, creating comedy for the viewers under her breath. The subversion of expectations, where this innocent-looking girl breaks out and flourishes as the teacher's right hand man, creates a comedic but beautiful storyline.</p>

                <h3 id="marissa-profile">Marissa's Positioning</h3>
                <div class="profile">
                    <img src="images/marissa-cropped.png">
                    <p>Marissa positions herself in the front of the class, but she sits right next to the window, off to the side. She is much like Colin in her personality, in that she has next to none for many seasons. As the show goes on and nears its end, the writers attempt to bring her more into the fray as she becomes a confident but still slightly awkward girl, but she ends up feeling like a shoddy copy of Heather. Due to the windows, the cameras tend to pan more to the left than the right to avoid blown out lighting. As such, putting Marissa to the front and closest to the windows makes her less important in the show, as viewers see her less than the characters on the left side.</p>
