            <p>Sometimes, it is easier to understand a concept visually than textually. The team at Creating Life hopes that this collage of images will help readers understand the similarities and differences in character progression across different pieces of media, or different arcs in one piece of media.</p>
            <p>The first section depicts how characters' appearances, whether that be symbolism or outfits, can affect how they are seen both in the universe and by viewers as story elements. When creating a character, it is important to put thought into their fashion sense and what they are trying to evoke, as well as what you want them to evoke as a person.</p>
            <p>The second section shows how the type of people that a character surrounds themselves by helps to develop their character arcs and progression. As relationships change throughout a piece of media, the characters make each other more complex and interesting, developing more depth for viewers to engage and identify with.</p>

            <p>The characters here are all part of the Justice League, a superhero team, but they have vastly different personalities that can be seen through their outfits and symbolism. While Superman (Picture #2) has a clearly visible face, slicked back hair, and a prominently colored logo on his chest, Batman (Picture #5) is anonymously wearing all black with a logo that can barely be perceived.</p>
            <p>Wonder Woman (Picture #4) is one of the few characters in the group without anything sharp associated with her, like weapons or logos. She is also one of the only characters with free flowing hair in the open, and is wearing the least armor (either showing her skills in combat or the writers' misogyny shining through).</p>
            <p>Cyborg is unfortunately one of the least developed characters, falling into an unfortunately common and covertly racist trope of Black men being depicted in robotic ways (connecting to the concept of using people of color for service, as opposed to letting them just be their own human beings). This depiction explains why this character is less discussed than any of the others, and does not have his own movie.</p>
            <p>Despite each character being a DC superhero, they all have their own appearances and personalities, for better or for worse. This shows how character arcs and depth can be written visually just as much as verbally.</p>

            <p>Carl Gallagher in Shameless goes through a variety of arcs, and the people he surrounds himself with shows his growth through the seasons. He starts off as a child being taken care of by his older siblings due to the lack of stable parents in their home, explaining why he ends up acting out often at school at this point in his life.</p>
            <p>As he grows up, he quickly falls in with a bad group, selling guns and drugs in his school bathroom. This leads to him going to juvie and then starting a fan favorite arc: White Boy Carl. He believes himself to be partly a Black man due to his association with Black men in juvie, his Black best friend, and his Black brother. He uses this to flirt with Dominique, a Black girl.</p>
            <p>After witnessing a gruesome murder initiated by his friend from juvie, Carl begins finding himself outside of his criminality and race shifting. He surrounds himself by people like a police chief, and eventually a military brat who he ends up dating. He goes to military school, and when he gets back, he becomes a cop.</p>
            <p>However, Carl was surrounded by a variety of bad cops, whether they be lazy or abusive. He wanted to defend, protect, and serve his community, and in his quest to tackle the issues in the cop system, he was demoted to a traffic cop. However, he surrounded himself with people supportive to his cause, and he made sure to use his power to protect his people.</p>
            <p>Carl surrounds himself by many people in his 11 seasons on screen, and they all affect who he is and who he becomes. His story makes sense because of the people who changed his life over the years, and the many phases he went through made him a fan favorite throughout the entire show. This shows how strengthening a character's relationships in a show, whether they be good or bad relationships, can help a character grow and become more intriguing and special to viewers.</p>
