            <p>Sometimes, it is easier to understand a concept visually than textually. The team at Creating Life hopes that this collage of images will help readers understand the similarities and differences in character progression across different pieces of media, or different arcs in one piece of media.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#appearances">first section</a> depicts how characters' appearances, whether that be symbolism or outfits, can affect how they are seen both in the universe and by viewers as story elements. When creating a character, it is important to put thought into their fashion sense and what they are trying to evoke, as well as what you want them to evoke as a person.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#relationships">second section</a> shows how the type of people that a character surrounds themselves by helps to develop their character arcs and progression. As relationships change throughout a piece of media, the characters make each other more complex and interesting, developing more depth for viewers to engage and identify with.</p>
            <p>The <a href="#everydayitems">third section</a> uses all the information that this site has provided throughout its creation to go further and talk specifically about character creation. The analysis we have done so far helps us understand how to create characters, and that spark of creativity can come from even the most basic, everyday items.</p>

            <p>The characters here are all part of the Justice League, a superhero team, but they have vastly different personalities that can be seen through their outfits and symbolism. While <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superman" target="_blank">Superman</a> (Picture #2) has a clearly visible face, slicked back hair, and a prominently colored logo on his chest, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman" target="_blank">Batman</a> (Picture #5) is anonymously wearing all black with a logo that can barely be perceived.</p>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman" target="_blank">Wonder Woman</a> (Picture #4) is one of the few characters in the group without anything sharp associated with her, like weapons or logos. She is also one of the only characters with free flowing hair in the open, and is wearing the least armor (either showing her skills in combat or the writers' misogyny shining through).</p>
            <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg_(DC_Comics)" target="_blank">Cyborg</a> (Picture #3) is unfortunately one of the least developed characters, falling into an unfortunately common and covertly racist trope of Black men being depicted in robotic ways (connecting to the concept of using people of color for service, as opposed to letting them just be their own human beings). This depiction explains why this character is less discussed than any of the others, and does not have his own movie.</p>
            <p>Despite each character being a DC superhero, they all have their own appearances and personalities, for better or for worse. We could continue to compare and contrast all of these characters for a long time, which is a good sign. This shows how character arcs and depth can be written visually just as much as verbally.</p>

            <p><a href="https://shameless.fandom.com/wiki/Carl_Gallagher_(US)" target="_blank">Carl Gallagher</a> in Shameless goes through a variety of arcs, and the people he surrounds himself with shows his growth through the seasons. He starts off as a child being taken care of by his older siblings due to the lack of stable parents in their home, explaining why he ends up acting out often at school at this point in his life.</p>
            <p>As he grows up, he quickly falls in with a bad group, selling guns and drugs in his school bathroom. This leads to him going to juvie and then starting a fan favorite arc: White Boy Carl. He believes himself to be partly a Black man due to his association with Black men in juvie, his Black best friend, and his Black brother. He uses this to flirt with Dominique, a Black girl.</p>
            <p>After witnessing a gruesome murder initiated by his friend from juvie, Carl begins finding himself outside of his criminality and race shifting. He surrounds himself by people like a police chief, and eventually a military brat who he ends up dating. He goes to military school, and when he gets back, he becomes a cop.</p>
            <p>However, Carl was surrounded by a variety of bad cops, whether they be lazy or abusive. He wanted to defend, protect, and serve his community, and in his quest to tackle the issues in the cop system, he was demoted to a traffic cop. However, he surrounded himself with people supportive to his cause, and he made sure to use his power to protect his people.</p>
            <p>Carl surrounds himself by many people in his 11 seasons on screen, and they all affect who he is and who he becomes. His story makes sense because of the people who changed his life over the years, and the many phases he went through made him a fan favorite throughout the entire show. This shows how strengthening a character's relationships in a show, whether they be good or bad relationships, can help a character grow and become more intriguing and special to viewers.</p>

            <p>While we have been analyzing a lot of characters and decisions made around characters, the team at Creating Life also believe in the importance of using our character analysis knowledge to create some of our own. One incredibly simple way to do this is to look around one's house and see what everyday items they have lying around! As such, here are some examples of items that the CEO has around his house, items that had become invisible due to sitting there for so long but now have reclaimed some intrigue by looking at them through a new lens.</p>
            <p>An old flip phone. Why would a character you're writing have this? Perhaps the setting for your story is in the past, when these are common, or even further back, when only the techiest of people would have access to one. Maybe the character is poor and using what they can get their hands on. Maybe they're a criminal and know that it is easier to get away with their antics using a phone such as this, or they have severe anxiety or focus issues so a smartphone would be detrimental to them.</p>
            <p>A fidget spinner. A character with this may be trying to fit in and seem cool, either in the era of the fidget spinner craze or an older person trying to fit in with youngsters after the craze was already dead and buried. Maybe your character is a tinkerer, and enjoys the mechanism behind the fidget spinner so they keep it around to play with it and iterate upon it. Does your character keep it on them at all times, or is it maybe displayed somewhere? The context of where viewers see this fidget spinner in relation to the character can change how the character is portrayed and understood.</p>
            <p>A loofah. It is a pleasant yellow shade, and loofahs are intrinsically soft and comfortable. Is this one of many luxuries that your character is afforded, or is it one of the only nice things they have? How does your character treat the loofah? Is it something they use every time they shower, or does it just sit there, reminding them of a time when they were younger and life felt more pleasant.</p>
            <p>An array of outlets. Often these are used to organize wires, so maybe your character is incredibly clean! On the other hand, maybe they are trying to be but struggling, and that's why this array is sitting unplugged and unused and has been for a long time. Maybe the character loves tech and needs this array to allow all of their wires to fit, or maybe they hate tech and want all of it hidden away as much as possible using the array. As we're seeing with these items, there is no singular option for what an everyday item can evoke in your character creation process.</p>
            <p>Chapstick. What time of the year or climate is your character in? Perhaps you have not hinted to it as much, but when viewers see chapstick, they may wonder if everything is extra dry at the moment. Or, perhaps your character has dry lips in general. Remember that you can iterate when you're creating a character--there are no rules. Maybe instead of just dry lips, your character has dry skin, too. Dry skin and psoriasis can be triggered by anxiety, so perhaps your character is currently struggling immensely and the chapstick is there to show that. In one episode of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Dee struggles with this exact thing (in a less subtle way).</p>
            <p>A moose plush. This moose has hands (hooves?) that clasp together, suggesting that it was hugging something previously. Where did the secondary item go? Perhaps this moose plush has travelled long and far with the character, and suffered a great deal over the journey, symbolizing the pain the character has also gone through. Considering this is a real item that the CEO owns, he knows that the moose plush used to be hugging another moose, which hugged back. As such, this can also be written into your character. Did your character give the other half of this toy to someone? Who was it, why were they important to the character?</p>
            <p>As you can see, simple items that you see around your house every day can evoke a great deal of creativity and give you ideas for who your character could be. Maybe instead of a fidget spinner it is another, similar toy, or instead of a moose plush it is a tiger. In fact, maybe the item itself is vastly different when you actually start writing, but the feeling it evokes is the same. You can always take something from an exercise such as this, no matter how small.</p>
