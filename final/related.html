            <p>We here at Creating Life know that many creative people, people who want to develop media of their own, will be searching for information such as that found on this blog. As such, we wanted to give them access to related materials that they could use to complete their creative projects.</p>
            <p>In a more and more AI-riddled world, with more slop being thrown onto the Internet for mass consumption, we hope that providing greater creative access to readers will remind people of what we can do as a society when we treat art with the respect it deserves.</p>
