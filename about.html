            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>This blog is run by creative people who are passionate about media production. Through this website, readers can see how characters were developed in various, popular pieces of media, whether those be shows, movies, novels, or video games. We tackle the core issues and patterns in writing interesting characters with depth to their story, and attempt to analyze why lesser-loved characters may have struggled to gain audience attraction after their debut. A blog like this ultimately hopes to create a deeper appreciation in its audience to the time and energy that goes into creating well-written characters, and hopes to propel them forward in their own creative journies.</p>
